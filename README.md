# python.rb -snake-game-

# Hello everyone, this is a simple but funny Snake Game (The same one that everybody once played at their old Nokia).

# Please, read the following instructions for its correct execution:

## 1. You will need to have Ruby installed and working in your pc to execute this code. You can download it at https://rubyinstaller.org/
# WARNING: In order to run this project you *must* download and install the version *3.0.3* of Ruby in your device, newest versions (up to date there's the 3.1 which is one update ahead of 3.0.3) are not working with the dependency we are going to use to emulate a desktop app. (I contacted the devs and they told me that they're aware of this bug, and are currently trying to fix it, so up to date there's no other choice than use the Ruby version 3.0.3 or any other older).

## 2. Once you have Ruby in your device, you have to install the gem "ruby2d", link to their website: https://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started/, or simply just run the following code in you terminal *gem install ruby2d*. With this dependency you will be able to emulate a desktop app where we're going to try our game (with this dependency we can also create this kind of small games in ruby).

## 3. Just open the project folder with your terminal and run the following command: *ruby python.rb*. It should open a window and the game will start! 

### I hope you enjoy it!
