# python.rb -snake-game-

# Hi everyone! this is just a simple but funny Snake Game (The same one that everybody played at least once with their old Nokia).

# Please, read the following instructions in order for its correct execution:

## 1. You will need to have Ruby installed and working in your pc to be able to execute this code. You can download its installer at https://rubyinstaller.org/
# WARNING: In order to run this project or any other created with ruby2d, you *must* download and install the version *3.0.3* of Ruby in your device, newest versions (up to date there's the 3.1 which is one update ahead of 3.0.3) are not working with the mentioned dependency which we are going to use to emulate a desktop app.

### 1.2 note: (I was having a lot of troubles so I managed to contact the ruby2d devs and they told me that they're aware of this error, and they are currently trying to fix it, but up to date there's no other choice than using the version 3.0.3 of Ruby (or any older you might want to use)).

## 2. Once you have Ruby in your device, you have to install the gem "ruby2d" (gems are packages for Ruby, just like the npm for JS, or the pyp for Python), link to their website: https://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started/, or just run the following code in you terminal: *gem install ruby2d*. With this dependency you will be able to emulate the desktop app where you're going to test the game (with this dependency you can also create this kind of small apps in ruby, feel free to check it out later).

## 3. Just open the project folder with your terminal and run the following command: *ruby python.rb*. It should open a desktop app window and the game will start! 

### I hope you enjoy it and happy gaming!
