# python.rb -snake-game-

# Hello everyone, this is a simple but funny Snake Game (The same one that everybody once played at their old Nokia).

# Please, read the following instructions for its correct execution:

## 1. You will need to have Ruby correctly installed in your pc to execute this code. You can find it at https://rubyinstaller.org/
# WARNING: You must install the version 3.0.3 of Ruby in your device, newest versions (up to date there's the 3.1 following the 3.0.3) are not working with the dependency we are going to use to emulate a desktop app. (I contacted the devs they told me they are trying to fix this, but up to date there's no other choice than use Ruby 3.0.3 which is the second newest release).

## 2. Once you have Ruby, you have to install the gem "ruby2d", link to their website: https://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started/, or just simply run *gem install ruby2d* in you terminal. With this dependency you will be able to emulate a desktop app where we're going to try our game (it's also a dependecy to program small games in ruby).

## 3. Just open the project and run in your terminal, ruby python.rb 

### I hope you enjoy it!
